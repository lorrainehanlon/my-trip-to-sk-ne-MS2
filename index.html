      <p>If you are flying from another country the closest airport is Copenhagen Kastrup. From there, it is only a 20
        train journey across the öresund Bridge to central Malmö. Skåne also has excellent rail links with the rest of
        mainland Europe.
      </p>
      <h3>What is the best way to get around Skåne?</h3>
      <p>All of Skåne can be reached within approximately two hours, so it is very easy to get about. You can easily
        rent a car in any of the main cities such as Malmö, Lund or Helsingborg. However Skåne also has excellent public
        transport links if you prefer to relax when you travel! You can download the Skånetrafiken app here and use this
        to buy a ticket that suits your trip.</p>
